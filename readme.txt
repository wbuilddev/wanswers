SEO-first community Q&A. Every question gets its own URL, QAPage JSON-LD schema, Open Graph tags, and Speakable markup - out of the box.

== Description ==

wAnswers turns your WordPress site into a structured community Q&A platform. Every question is a WordPress post with its own canonical URL, server-rendered HTML, and complete QAPage JSON-LD schema - the exact format Google uses to surface Q&A content in rich snippets, People Also Ask boxes, and AI Overviews.

No JavaScript rendering. No iframe embeds. No third-party dependencies. No jQuery.

**Live demo:** https://wbuild.dev/questions/

= Why wAnswers Is Different: SEO & GEO First =

Most Q&A plugins render everything via a single shortcode page - one URL, no per-question structured data, effectively invisible to crawlers. wAnswers works the opposite way.

Every question gets its own permanent URL (`/questions/my-question/`). Every page ships with the structured data Google and AI search engines need to surface your content in search results, rich snippets, and AI citations.

= GEO (Generative Engine Optimisation) =

AI search engines like Perplexity, ChatGPT Browse, and Google AI Overviews favour content with clear Q&A structure, explicit authorship, date signals, topic tagging, and Speakable content markers. wAnswers outputs all of these automatically on every question page.

= Core Q&A Features =

* Ask questions with a title and optional body text
* Categorise questions by topic (custom taxonomy with live AJAX filter)
* Answer questions inline with no page reload
* Accept an answer (question author or admin only)
* Threaded replies on answers - one level deep
* Sort questions: Newest, Top Voted, Most Answered, Unanswered
* Filter by topic with instant AJAX
* Live search within the feed
* Load-more pagination - no full page reloads
* Edit questions and answers within a 1-hour window
* Delete your own questions and answers

= Voting & Scoring =

* Upvote and downvote questions and answers
* Cannot vote on your own posts
* Lifetime vote tracking that persists across leaderboard resets
* Automatic backfill for users who existed before vote tracking was added

* Four tabs: Top Score, Most Questions, Most Answers, Most Accepted
* Five position options: none, above feed, below feed, sidebar left, sidebar right
* Optional sticky sidebar

[wanswers_leaderboard limit="5"] - Show top 5 users per tab (default is 10).

= No External Dependencies =

The plugin JavaScript is vanilla JS with no jQuery requirement. Styles are self-contained with no external CDN requests. Everything runs on your server.

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin zip file.
2. Go to Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin in your WordPress admin.
3. Upload the zip file and click Install Now.
4. Click Activate Plugin.
5. Go to Settings > Permalinks and click Save Changes. This flushes rewrite rules and is required once after first installation.
6. Visit Questions > Settings to configure the plugin.

= Manual Installation =

1. Unzip the plugin folder into `/wp-content/plugins/wanswers/`
2. Activate the plugin from the Plugins screen.
3. Go to Settings > Permalinks and click Save Changes.

= After Activation =

* Your Q&A feed is live at yoursite.com/questions/
* Individual questions are served at yoursite.com/questions/question-title/
* User profiles are served at yoursite.com/questions/author/username/
* Add topics at Questions > Q&A Topics
* Customise the archive page heading and description at Questions > Settings

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it work with any theme? =

Yes. The plugin uses its own page templates that call get_header() and get_footer() from your active theme. All styles are self-contained. You can override any template by placing a copy in your theme root folder - for example yourtheme/single-wanswers_question.php.

= Will it conflict with Yoast SEO or RankMath? =

No. If either plugin is active, their title and meta description tags take precedence on Q&A pages. The plugin's JSON-LD schema blocks output independently and do not conflict with SEO plugin schema output.

= How do I prevent duplicate content if I use both /questions/ and a shortcode page? =

Enable "Noindex shortcode pages" in Questions > Settings. This adds a noindex meta tag to any page containing the [wanswers_qa] shortcode so only the CPT archive at /questions/ is indexed. Alternatively, enable Homepage Mode - your Q&A then has only one canonical URL at your site root.

= What is Homepage Mode? =

Homepage Mode serves the Q&A feed directly at your site root (yoursite.com/) instead of at yoursite.com/questions/. To use it, go to Settings > Reading and set "Your homepage displays" to "Your latest posts", then enable Homepage Mode in Questions > Settings. The /questions/ archive issues a 301 redirect to / automatically. Individual question pages at /questions/slug/ are unaffected.

= Can users edit their questions and answers? =

Yes, within a 1-hour window after posting. After that window, only administrators and editors can edit content. The time limit is enforced server-side.

= How does email delivery work? =

Notifications are sent via wp_mail() using your site's configured mail settings. For reliable delivery it is recommended to use a transactional email plugin such as WP Mail SMTP, Postmark for WordPress, or SendGrid.

= Is jQuery required? =

No. The plugin JavaScript is written in vanilla JS with no jQuery dependency.

= Does it create custom database tables? =

Yes. Two tables are created on activation: one for vote records and one for email subscriptions. Both are prefixed with your WordPress table prefix. Data is removed if you uninstall the plugin via the Plugins screen.

= Can I remove the "Powered by wAnswers" credit? =

Yes, absolutely. Go to Questions > Settings > Footer Credit and uncheck the option. The credit is shown by default but is entirely optional and not required.

= Does it work with WordPress Multisite? =

The plugin has not been tested on Multisite installations and is not officially supported in that environment.

== External services ==

= Gravatar =

This plugin uses the Gravatar service to display user profile images on member profile pages. When a user visits a member profile page, the plugin requests an avatar image from Gravatar based on the member's email address (hashed with MD5).

Data sent: an MD5 hash of the user's email address, included in the image URL.
When: each time a member profile page is loaded.
